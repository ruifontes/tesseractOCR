* Compatibility: NVDA version 2019.3 and beyond


## Information

This add-on uses the free and open source Tesseract OCR engine, to perform optical character recognition on an image file, PDF, JPG, TIF or other, without the need to open it.
The text file will be placed at same folder with the same name of the original file but with .TXT extension.
It also allows access to WIA enabled scanners to perform OCR to a paper document.
The results are shown in a file named OCR.txt placed in users Documents folder.
At last, it also can get the accessible text from an accessible PDF, using XPDF tools.
In the NVDA menu, Preferences, a TesseractOCR section is added, where you can configure the following:
- languages to be used in recognition;
- the type of documents to be recognized;
- if should be asked or not a PDF password. If you have this option checked, and the PDF does not have a password, just press Enter in the dialog asking for password;
- set the scanner resolution between 150 and 400 dpi;
- Option to detect the paper orientation;
- Option to use or not tones to signalize the work progress.

With the exception of English and Portuguese, which are already included in add-on, the other languages will be downloaded and installed when you select a language that does not already exist in the add-on.
Note that as the number of selected recognition languages increases, the OCR process will take longer.
We therefore recommend that you use only the languages you need.
Note also that the quality of recognition may vary according to the order of languages.
Therefore, if the recognition result is not satisfactory, you may want to try another language ordering.


## Shortcut

The default commands are:
Windows+Control+w - to scan and recognize a document through the scanner;
Windows+Control+r - to recognize the selected document;
Windows+Control+t - To get the text from an accessible PDF;
Windows+Control+c - To cancel the scanning process.
Please note: It must be issued before the dialog asking if you want to scan more pages appear!

Then just wait the text file appears with the recognized text.

This commands can be modified in the "Input gestures" dialog in the "TesseractOCR" section.


## Known problems

* When selecting the "Various" option in the "Documents type" combobox, the recognized text probably appear with many blank lines
This is a known problem with Tesseract, and, without consumming lots of processing time, I haven't yet found any solution. But, I still haven't given up!
